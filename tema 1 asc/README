    Assignment 1 - Cluster Activity Simulation
    March 2015


Description
--------------
Simulation of a computational cluster. The cluster consists of:
* FEP nodes (front-end processors)
* nodes with both computational and storage functionalities

The FEP nodes are implemented by the testing infrastructure (tester.py module).
The computational nodes must be implemented as part of the assignment (node.py 
module). 
The data is partitioned and stored in the nodes objects. A node must
communicate with other nodes if it needs data. The nodes
receive tasks that modify the data shared by them.


Usage
-----

Run all the tests using the run_tests script

./run_tests

For generating and running your own tests or random ones, please see the 
documentation, and modify tester.py's main.
